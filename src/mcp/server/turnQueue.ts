/**
 * Voice turn queue — bridges incoming STT transcripts to the agent's
 * `next_voice_turn()` polls.
 *
 * Architecture: MCP is a pull protocol. The bridge cannot push voice turns to
 * the agent; incoming turns are enqueued here and the agent calls
 * `next_voice_turn()` to dequeue.
 *
 * Long-poll pattern: if no turn is ready, `dequeue()` suspends until one
 * arrives or the timeout elapses. Latency stays low without busy-polling.
 *
 * Delivery order for one incoming turn:
 *   1. a waiting `next_voice_turn()` poll, else
 *   2. AgentVoice's interrupt hook (server/pendingWaits.ts) — whichever of OUR
 *      tools the agent is currently blocked in, else
 *   3. the buffer, for the agent's next poll.
 *
 * Step 2 is protocol-level, so it works identically on Cursor, Codex and
 * Claude Code — nothing here depends on a particular CLI.
 *
 * Streamed input (voice.inputMode = "stream", or `agentvoice pipe`) enqueues
 * one turn per audio segment. When several are waiting, a dequeue hands them
 * over together — the agent gets everything said since it last listened,
 * rather than one clause per poll. See docs/41-audio-stream-pipe.md.
 *
 * See docs/16-mcp-server-agent-as-brain.md § 8.1 / § 8.4.
