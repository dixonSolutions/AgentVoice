/**
 * Listener envelope — the presence signal that rides on every agent-voice tool
 * result (docs/36 §3.1).
 *
 * MCP is pull-only. There is no way for the bridge to push "the user just put
 * their phone down" into a running Cursor, Codex, Claude Code or Codewhale
 * process. The only channel that reaches all four is the result of a tool they
 * already call, which is why the pending-user-turn notice was hung off
 * `speak()` in the first place.
 *
 * This wrapper generalises that: every AgentVoice tool result gains a
 * `listener` block with the presence state, how long the user has been away,
 * the policy in force and one line of instruction. An agent that never calls
 * `speak()` — one grinding through its own Read/Bash tools — still learns the
 * user has gone the next time it touches any AgentVoice tool.
 *
 * It is also the natural place to charge the unattended tool-call budget:
 * every agent-voice call while away is one tick, and the budget verdict comes
 * back in the same envelope.
