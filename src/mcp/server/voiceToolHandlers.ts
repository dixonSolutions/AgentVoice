/**
 * Voice I/O tool handlers for the AgentVoice MCP server.
 *
 * The voice agent calls these tools to interact with the user over voice:
 *   speak(text)         — push text to TTS, forward audio to PWA
 *   done()              — signal PWA to re-arm mic for next wake word
 *   next_voice_turn()   — long-poll dequeue of next user utterance
 *
 * The `speak` path mirrors the llm_intelligence `onSpeak` callback: it sends
 * { type: "speak", text } to all connected intelligence WebSocket clients.
 *
 * See docs/16-mcp-server-agent-as-brain.md.
