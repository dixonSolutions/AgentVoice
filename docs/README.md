# AgentVoice — Documentation

Voice-controlled coding agent: speak from an iPhone PWA, the active agent CLI
(Cursor / Codex / Claude Code) reasons with full project context, and a constrained
MCP tool layer drives worker agents on projects hosted on a home machine.

> Status: **Implemented.** This folder is the source of truth for architecture and
> behavior. Update these docs when the codebase changes (see `08-decisions-and-risks.md`).

## One-paragraph summary

The **phone** (iPhone Safari PWA) captures speech with **browser STT**, falling
back to whichever server engine is configured — self-hosted Whisper, Groq,
OpenAI, Deepgram, Gemini, ElevenLabs, OpenRouter, or Amazon Transcribe
([`29-speech-to-text-providers.md`](./29-speech-to-text-providers.md)) — and
plays replies with **WebKit TTS** or **Amazon Polly**.
Utterances flow over **`/ws/intelligence`** to the bridge, which queues them for
the active coding agent (Cursor / Codex / Claude Code) via the **`agent-voice`
MCP server** (`next_voice_turn`, `speak`, `done` — renamed from `cursor-voice`;
see [`28-provider-parity-and-branding.md`](./28-provider-parity-and-branding.md)). The
agent is the conversational brain; coding work is delegated to **worker** CLI
processes via `spawn_agent`. Networking defaults to **Tailscale** but is
pluggable ([`25-hosting-providers.md`](./25-hosting-providers.md)); every bridge
request is validated with a **single app token**.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Who reasons | Audio path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`agent_native`** (default) | the active coding CLI via MCP | PWA STT/TTS ↔ bridge ↔ MCP `speak()` |
| **`llm_intelligence`** | Claude on Bedrock Converse | Same PWA STT/TTS; bridge orchestrator |

Speech-to-speech (OpenAI Realtime, Nova Sonic) was removed. AWS IAM keys in `.env`
power **Polly**, **Transcribe**, and **Bedrock Converse** only.

## Confirmed key decisions

- **Default workflow:** `agent_native` — the active coding CLI controls voice via MCP.
- **Audio:** Cascade STT + TTS (not S2S). WebKit first; Amazon fallback on desktop.
- **Wake/submit:** Vosk offline grammar for wake/end phrases; Silero VAD for speech-end.
- **Safety:** Constrained MCP tool set + project allowlist + git revert.
- **Auth:** Single app token on every HTTP, WebSocket, and MCP request.
