/**
 * One microphone owner for the app's lifetime (docs/40 §4, #66).
 *
 * Four separate places used to call `getUserMedia` on their own — the
 * session's shared stream, the Vosk wake-word spotter, server STT, and the
 * wake-word test page — and each of them called `track.stop()` when it was
 * done. Stopping the last track releases the device, so the *next* session
 * asked the browser for the microphone all over again. On iOS Safari, where a
 * site defaults to "Ask", that is a permission prompt every single time the
 * user starts talking, which is the one thing a hands-free interface cannot
 * afford.
 *
 * So: acquire once, hand the same `MediaStream` to every borrower, and mute
 * (`track.enabled = false`) rather than stop when the last one lets go. The
 * device is released only after a quiet period, because an open microphone
 * keeps the browser's recording indicator lit and users reasonably read that
 * as the app listening when it is not.
 *
 * What the platform will and will not do, since the design turns on it:
 *
 *   - Chrome (desktop and Android) generally remembers a granted microphone
 *     per HTTPS origin; Android may offer "only this time", which this cannot
 *     override.
 *   - Safari on iOS defaults to "Ask" per site and home-screen PWAs have
 *     historically re-prompted more often. Keeping the track alive is what
 *     avoids the repeat prompt within a session; across launches the user has
 *     to set the site to "Allow" themselves, which the onboarding card
 *     explains.
 *   - Firefox grants are temporary unless "Remember this decision" is ticked.
 *   - No web page can make audio *playback* permanent — a user gesture is
 *     required after every launch. The orb tap is that gesture.
 *
 * The native shell (docs/20) is the only way to get OS-level persistence.
